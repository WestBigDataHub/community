# Ad-hoc interest and focus groups

[How to add your group!](ad-hoc-posting-guidelines.html)

This is where links out to other people, groups, etc. will go.  Here's

For each ad-hoc group we can offer:

* a slack channel
* help setting up a project page for sharing files and documentation on the [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io/)
