# Speaker request guidelines

## Connect with the Hub!

Are you looking to build connections with the Hub?  The Hub director,
Meredith Lee, or members of the
[leadership team and steering committee](http://westbigdatahub.org/people/),
may be available to speak at or otherwise participate in your event!
Note that The Hub has very limited travel support and generally will
not be able to fund any travel or lodging.  Please contact us at
someone@somewhere.org and we will get back to you!

## Need a Big Data speaker?

We can also suggest local or national speakers for your event!
Generally you should expect to fully support travel and lodging.
Please contact us at someone@somewhere.org with event information and
we will get back to you!
