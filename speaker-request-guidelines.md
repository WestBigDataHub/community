# Speaker request guidelines

## Connect with the Hub!

Are you looking to build connections with the Hub?  The Hub director,
Meredith Lee, or members of the steering committee (link here), may be
available to co-organize, attend, speak at, and/or participate in your
event!  Note that The Hub has very limited travel support and
generally will not be able to fund any travel or lodging.
Please contact us at someone@somewhere.org and we will get back to
you!

## Need a Big Data speaker?

We can also suggest local or national speakers for your event!
Generally you should expect to fully support travel and lodging.
Please contact us at someone@somewhere.org with event information and
we will get back to you!
