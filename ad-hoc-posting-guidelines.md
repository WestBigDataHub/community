# How to post your own focus or interest group!

The easiest and most direct is to either
[create an issue on our GitHub site](https://github.com/WestBigDataHub/WestBigDataHub.github.io/issues/new)
or [directly edit the file on GitHub](ad-hoc-interest.md) and submit a Pull
Request.  You'll need to have a GitHub account to do either of those.

If you prefer, you can send an e-mail to someone@somewhere.com.  To
make sure we have all of the necessary information, please copy and
paste the below text into an e-mail.  Please - no highlighting or
fonts!

```

Involved groups and institutions:

* [institution 1](http://webpage)

Primary contact e-mail address: contact@institution.org
